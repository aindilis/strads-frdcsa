(2019-07-08 04:41:51 <aindilis> on pg. 41 of Cycorp-RKF-Proposal.pdf it
       mentions STRADS, which I assume to be a Monte-Carlo precursor to ScenGen
 2019-07-08 04:42:47 <aindilis> I read up on it, and while I would prefer
       something with branching time, path quantifiers, and
       verification/theorem-proving, I suppose I will first initiate WOPR using
       this layout, and iterate
 2019-07-08 04:43:56 <aindilis> for the first time just now I realized how
       GDL-II could be used in KB-Simulation technology 
 2019-07-08 04:44:30 <aindilis> you could put the geopolitical
       reactions into the KB, sort of nondeterministically, and then run a GDL
       solver on it
 2019-07-08 04:46:14 <aindilis> it's not that I couldn't have figured out how
       to implement a STRADS-like system, it's just validating to see how
       others approached the problem to see what the watermark is
 2019-07-08 04:46:56 <aindilis> I think I will code a very simple version of
       STRADS-FRDCSA right now
 2019-07-08 04:52:05 <aindilis> I suppose future work should integrate complete
       deliberative reasoning systems capable of asking wide ranging HPKB-like
       questions into the milieu
 2019-07-08 04:52:26 <aindilis> to model boundedly-rational agents
